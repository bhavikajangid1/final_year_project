# Raspberry Pi Robocar Project

## Overview

This project is a Raspberry Pi-based robocar that provides manual control, obstacle avoidance, and line following capabilities. The project includes three iterations (`manual_mode.py`, `ir_sensor_obj_avoid.py`, and `linefol_objavoid.py`), each implementing different functionalities for controlling the robot.

## Project Structure

- `manual_mode.py`: Python script for manual control of the robot using the keyboard.
- `ir_sensor_obj_avoid.py`: Python script implementing obstacle avoidance using infrared sensors.
- `linefol_objavoid.py`: Python script combining line following and obstacle avoidance.

## Dependencies

- Python 3
- [RPi.GPIO](https://pypi.org/project/RPi.GPIO/) library (for Raspberry Pi GPIO control)

## Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bhavikajangid1/final-year-project.git
cd final-year-project
```
### 2. Install Dependencies

Before running the project, you need to install the required Python libraries. Open a terminal on your Raspberry Pi and run the following command:

```bash
pip install RPi.GPIO
```
### 3. Hardware Setup

Before running the project, connect the necessary hardware components to your Raspberry Pi. The specific hardware requirements are as follows:

#### Hardware Components
- Motors
- Infrared Sensors 
- Ultrasonic Sensors 
- Motor Drivers for Front and Back Motors
- Any other peripherals required for your specific setup
  
#### Motor Connections
##### Front Motors 
Connected to Motor Driver 1
  - **Front-Left Forward:** GPIO 17
  - **Front-Left Backward:** GPIO 18 
  - **Front-Right Forward:** GPIO 4
  - **Front-Right Backward:** GPIO 14
    
##### Back Motors
Connected to Motor Driver 2
  - **Back-Left Forward:** GPIO 12
  - **Back-Right Forward:** GPIO 27 
  - **Back-Left Backward:** GPIO 5 
  - **Back-Right Backward:** GPIO 6
  
#### Motor Driver Connections
  - Connect the necessary wires to GPIO pins on the Raspberry Pi and the corresponding input pins on the motor driver for the front motors.
    
#### Sensor Connections
##### Infrared Sensors
  - Connect the left infrared sensor to GPIO 19
  - the right infrared sensor to GPIO 26.
##### Ultrasonic Sensors
  - Connect the left ultrasonic sensor to GPIO 2 (trigger) and GPIO 3 (echo)
  - Connect the right ultrasonic sensor to GPIO 20 (trigger) and GPIO 21 (echo).

  Make sure to double-check all connections before powering on your Raspberry Pi to avoid any potential damage.
  
### Additional Notes

- Make sure to double-check all connections before running the scripts to avoid potential hardware damage.
- If encountering issues, refer to the [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) section or open an issue on GitHub for assistance.
